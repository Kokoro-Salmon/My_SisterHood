# My SisterHood
Hey, Check out SisterHood! It's this app We made during a Hackathon Focusing on Women’s Safety. We also took data from India Gov Data site, did Analysis using a Python notebook. You can get all Sorts of Safety Tips, see where Incidents have been reported on Google Maps, and even Dive into some in site stats made using Chart.js. We also made sure to include info on Women’s safety organizations And We are pretty Proud of How it came together!
