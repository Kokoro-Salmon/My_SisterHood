        question: `Has anyone been held accountable? Were there interventions from the police/authorities)?`,
        answer: `We focus on larger trends that are emerging in locations or by category. In several cases, on presenting the data, the police will take action based on the reports we received. This approach allows us to address issues proactively and improve overall safety. Additionally, it helps in identifying patterns that may not be immediately obvious but require attention.`,
    },
    {
        question: "Why do you feel there needs to be an app to report the incidents?",
        answer: `People who harass do so in their own comfort zones. Silence on the part of victims and bystanders makes the perpetrators more confident and the harassment only increases from cases like staring and indecent gestures to stalking and assault. An informal reporting system is required to share such information that could be trivial to report to the police but useful to someone else. While there is a move to make the implementation of legislations more effective, the question we ask is – as ordinary citizens, what can we do to create change?`,
    },
    {
        question: `Do I have to reveal my name and identity?`,
